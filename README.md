# textworld

A simple homemade framework to create drawings in the browser using a text-based display.

Supports drawing rudimentary shapes:
- Point
- Line
- Rectangle
- Ellipse
- Arc

Libraries used:
- Lodash
- simplex-noise.js* (jwagner)

\*This is included as I have been experimenting with it, but it is not actually implemented in the present version
