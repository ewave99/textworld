# textworld

A simple homemade framework to create drawings in the browser using a text-based display.

Supports drawing rudimentary shapes (with commands):
- Point
- Line
- Rectangle
- Ellipse
- Arc

Libraries used:
- Lodash

In the future: 
- Develop the 'drawing' branch to add a menu system to draw different kinds of shapes
- Find a way of loading a file containing ascii art
